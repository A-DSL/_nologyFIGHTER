Created for the _nology Game spec as part of a portfolio. Made with HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

The game adopts a simple 1-versus-1 rock-paper-scissors system. Players have 3 HP; Beam beats Blast, Blast beats Baseball Bat, and Baseball Bat beats Beam. The loser of a trade takes 1 damage, unless there is a tie.

Attacks also charge Energy. Energy gain is 10 per attack (bonus goal: ties produce an extra 5 energy for each side)

Once your Energy reaches a sufficient amount, you can unleash one of three supers; your opponent can only beat this super with 1 attack, with the other two causing a loss. Supers cost 30 Energy and are:

-Hyper Beam: Only loses to Baseball Bat/Homerun. 
-Explosion: Only loses to Beam/Ultra Beam. 
-Homerun: Only loses to Blast/Explosion.

The images for this game are a set of stick figures with white outlines, alongside some visuals for the previously used attack. All of these were made in Asesprite at specific dimensions (80x128px for stick figures), then exported as PNGs.
