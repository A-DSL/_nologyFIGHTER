Created for the _nology Game spec as part of a portfolio. Made with HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

The game adopts a simple 1-versus-1 rock-paper-scissors system. Players have 3 HP; Beam beats Blast, Blast beats Baseball Bat, and Baseball Bat beats Beam. The loser of a trade takes 1 damage, unless there is a tie.

Attacks also charge Energy. Energy gain is:

-Beam: 10
-Blast: 10
-Baseball Bat: 10

Once your Energy reaches a sufficient amount, you can unleash one of three supers; your opponent can only beat this super with 1 attack, with the other two causing a loss. Supers are:

-Ultra Beam: Costs 30 energy. Only loses to Baseball Bat. 
-Explosion: Costs 30 energy. Only loses to Beam. 
-Homerun: Costs 30 energy. Only loses to Blast.
