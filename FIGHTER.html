<!--Create two sections; one for P1 and one for P2. These will be flex-boxed to occupy 50% of the screen, and all dimensions within them will be relative to the screen size. Hopefully this works on phone!

Each section will consist of:
-A health and energy measurement at the top.
-Six buttons for attacking with. Top 3 are Normals, Bottom 3 are Supers.
-A division made specifically to hold the image.-->
